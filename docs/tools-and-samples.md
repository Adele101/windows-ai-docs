# Tools and samples

The [Windows-Machine-Learning repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning) contains sample applications that demonstrate how to use Windows Machine Learning, as well as tools that help verify models and troubleshoot issues during development.

## Samples

The following sample applications are available on GitHub.

## Tools

The following tools are available on GitHub.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [WinMLRunner](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Tools/WinMLRunner) | A command-line tool that can run .onnx or .pb models where the input and output variables are tensors or images. It will attempt to load, bind, and evaluate a model and output error messages if these steps were unsuccessful. Useful because it lets you run the WinML APIs against a model and see if it hits any issues before trying to integrate it into an application. |
